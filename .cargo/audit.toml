# Ignore RUSTSEC-2026-0002 (lru soundness issue) temporarily
# This is a transitive dependency through aws-sdk-s3 v1.119.0
# The issue affects lru 0.12.5 which is used by aws-sdk-s3
# Fixed in lru >= 0.16.3, but aws-sdk-s3 hasn't updated yet
# We don't directly use lru or its IterMut functionality
# TODO: Remove this ignore once aws-sdk-s3 updates to lru >= 0.16.3
